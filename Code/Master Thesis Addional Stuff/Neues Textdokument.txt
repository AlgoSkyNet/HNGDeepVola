Over the past two decades society and economy were disrupted by digitalisation. It fundamentally transformed major business sectors as the automobile, communication or commerce. Nowadays, it drives entrepreneurial innovation, productivity, and also has implications for the development of labor markets, and political participation. \textcite{joblossdigi} forecast that "around 47\% of total US employment is in the high risk category" which refers to working environments that they expect to be automated over the next decade. The increase of computational power and the linked rise of big data applications and advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithm are the main drivers of those developments. \\
Hence it is no surprise that this transformation does not not stop at the financial markets. The availability of intraday data as well as the achievements in the area of data driven algorithms provide a good framework to combine financial theory and machine learning techniques. According to the European Financial Management Association, roughly 35\% of European financial organizations have deployed at least one machine learning solution at the end of 2018. Further, they state that for those organizations that have yet to deploy a solution, 23\% believed they would have an AI solution in place within in a year (\cite{EFMA}).
Besides huge improvement in automating customer experience, e.g. detecting customer behavior patterns or automatised chatbot programs, huge improvements can be developed in modern risk management.\\
The appearance of financial markets shaped the modern economy and contributed to the economic growth by providing investment opportunities to a wide class of investors. Among those investments, derivative contracts play a huge role in today's risk management and investment decisions.
Since the first occurrence of modern derivatives end of last century, their importance increased significantly. In 2019, the total volume of futures and options contracts traded on exchanges worldwide reached an all time high with a record of 34.47 billion contracts (\cite{FIA}). According to the most recent data from the Bank for International Settlements, the total notional amounts outstanding for contracts in the derivatives market is at an all time high of an estimated  \$640 trillion (\cite{BIS}). The gross market value of all contracts sums up to approximately \$12.1 trillion. This roughly equals the nominal GDP of China in 2019 with \$14.1 trillion (\cite{WEO}). In light of such numbers, practitioners as well as researchers can  not afford to not thoroughly understand modelling and managing them. \\
Options are used in the economy for various reasons. Besides the obvious purely monetary driven reasons, they are widely used to increase a portfolio performance and, more generally, to transfer and manage risk. Consequently, pricing and analysing them must be dealt with great care and with sufficiently realistic models. Therefore researchers have spent years investigating pricing and hedging of such financial products. Starting with the work of \textcite{BS} and \textcite{Merton}, plethora of market models were introduced and analysed, each with its own upsides and flaws.
However, the over-reliance on this same formula and more generally the deviance in pricing of complex derivatives products have been highly criticized during the recent financial crisis.
